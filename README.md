# Statistical Solutions of Optimal Multivariate Reinsurance under Distortion Risk Measures
This github repository provides all the codes accompanying the paper "Statistical Solutions of Optimal Multivariate Reinsurance under Distortion Risk Measures." It involves the following **R** code files:

1. **sim1.R**: Replicates the results for Simulation 1 (Validity of the CLT-based Approximation; Section 4.1) of the paper.

2. **sim2a.R**, **sim2b.R**, **sim2c.R**: Replicate the results for Simulation 2 (Assessing Statistical Properties of Estimators; Section 4.2) of the paper under Cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

3. **real.R**: Replicates the results for Data Analysis (Section 5) of the paper using the Danish fire loss data. The Danish fire loss data is publicly available as **danishmulti** in the **R** package **CASdatasets**.
